Grievance Connect App
We're developing a social media platform where local residents can connect, share grievances, and promote community safety.
Users can post concerns like road issues or crime alerts, with the most upvoted ones gaining attention from local authorities.
With features like content verification and neighborhood-based alerts, the platform promotes trust and unity among residents.
By amplifying community voices, we aim to create safer, more responsive neighborhoods where everyone's concerns are heard and addressed.
